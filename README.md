# Test_task

Write a simple Android applications with following characteristics.

Text parsing:
One screen; with edit field for input string and “Parse” button
App contains dictionary of words
When user presses “Parse” application will segment the input string into a space-separated sequence of dictionary words if possible. Result will be displayed on the same screen.
For example, if the input string is "applepieshoe" and dictionary contains a standard set of English words, then app would display the strings "apple”, “pie" and “shoe” as output.
The app should display all the words found in input string, for example if the input string is “secondary” the app should display the strings “second” and “secondary”
